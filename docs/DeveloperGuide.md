# 1. **Overview**

This developer guide contains documentation on design architecture and details software design decisions in the implementation of Fridgy.
It is intended to be read by contributors, users, and future maintainers.

For more information on the Fridgy application, refer to the [_User Guide_](UserGuide.md) instead.

## 1.1 **About Fridgy**

Fridgy is a **desktop app for managing an Inventory of food as well as a list of recipes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Fridgy can get your fridge Inventory and recipe sorted out faster than traditional GUI apps.

Fridgy helps to manage and track your ingredients in the fridge. It can warn you about expiring ingredients and track your recipes in the Recipe Book. There will be more functionalities in the future, such as automatic deduction of ingredients after executing a recipe.

## 1.2 **Setting up, Getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/fridgy/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/fridgy/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete ingredient 1`. It is similar for operations on `Recipe`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/fridgy/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of:
1. `UIManager` which implements the `UI` interface, and hence is responsible for handling the initial setup when Fridgy is started e.g. initializing `MainWindow` and its parts.
2. `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ActiveDisplay`, `ingredientListPanel`, `recipeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI such as the handling of the interaction between these classes and their corresponding FXML files.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. As such, it follows closely to the typical JavaFX application structure. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/fridgy/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* displays the result of the command execution to the UI part `ResultDisplay`
* logs the result of the command execution.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Ingredient` and `Recipe` object residing in the `Model`.

### 2.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/fridgy/logic/Logic.java)

Here is a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FridgyParser` class to parse the user command.
1. `FridgyParser` parses the command string and returns a higher order function that exposes the execute interface of the resulting `Command` object which can communicate with a given `Model` when it is executed (e.g to add a recipe).
1. `Logic` applies the returned higher order function on the model it was constructed with.
1. The result of the execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete recipe 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="800"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FridgyParser` class checks if the command is a 'Typed' command (i.e. a command that pertains to Inventory or Recipes) or a 'General' command (such as "help" or "exit").
* "Typed" commands are sent to either `RecipeParser` or `InventoryParser` depending on the command type, while "General" commands are handled in `FridgyParser` directly.
* Inside `RecipeParser`/`InventoryParser`, commands that utilize arguments and require additional parsing will cause an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g. `AddCommandParser`) to be created.
* This `XYZCommandParser` is used to parse additional arguments and creates the `XYZCommand` object.
* The `FridgyParser` class then returns the `XYZCommand` object wrapped in an executable `CommandExecutor` that can be applied on a provided `Model` and return a `CommandResult.`
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 2.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/fridgy/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the Fridgy data i.e., all `Ingredient` and `Recipe` objects (which are contained in a `Database<Ingredient>` / `Database<Recipe>` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Ingredient` and `Recipe` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Ingredient>` and `Recipe` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the 'active' `Ingredient` or `Recipe` object that is displayed in detail in the UI component
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

The container for `Ingredient` is called `Inventory` and container for `Recipe` is called `RecipeBook`

The CRUD behavior of `Ingredient` and `Recipe` are similar as they are implemented using a generic base model `Database<T>` internally.

The base model objects are constructed as shown in the following class diagrams.

<img src="images/IngredientClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/RecipeClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Inventory`, which `Ingredient` references. This allows `Inventory` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Ingredient` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### 2.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/fridgy/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save `RecipeBook` and `Inventory` data as well as user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InventoryStorage`, `RecipeBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `fridgy.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Model Generic abstraction

At the fundamental level, both `Recipe` and `Ingredient` are using the same CRUD operations. To reduce code duplication, a generic class of `Database<T extends Eq>` is implemented.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `Eq` is an interface that ensures all objects entered into the Database has a weaker notion of equality defined by the developer. This is done as all our models do not allow duplicates defined by our weaker notion of equality. <br>
</div>

This implementation allow more flexibility in extending the application in the future. One can easily duplicate a database model by extending from the Database generic. For example, if I want to implement another model to keep track of student contacts, I can simply implement it with

```java
public class ContactBook extends Database<Person> {
    public ContactBook() {
        super(new UniqueDataList<>());
    }
    public ContactBook(ReadOnlyDatabase<Person> roBook) {
        super(roBook);
    }
}
```

However, do note that this implementation is purely contained within Model component. The `ModelManager` is still a facade that handles all operations from other components. That means all CRUD operations to new types of objects will need to be implemented and exposed through `ModelManager`.


### 3.2 Automatic Quantity Conversion

Currently,
1. Accepted SI prefixes are:
   - `k`: for kilo-
   - `m`: for milli-
2. Accepted base units are:
   - `g`: for grams
   - `l`: for litres

Do note that the user can choose not to include any units. It will be processed as a unit-less quantity.

The initial step is to use Regex to split the quantity into a `Double`, the SI prefix, and the base unit. The computation is done based on the prefix detected, and a relevant multiplier is used to convert the quantity into the base unit.

This is done for any incoming ingredient before the quantity is stored, and there are future plans to utilise this for other computations, such as deducting a quantity of ingredients in the inventory when a recipe is executed.
This also requires consistency in units for each ingredient.

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of ingredients and recipes
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage ingredients and recipes faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
