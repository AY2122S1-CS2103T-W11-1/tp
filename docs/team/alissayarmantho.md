### Project: Fridgy

* Fridgy is **a Food Inventory Manager** that makes it easy to reduce food waste by keeping track of what you have and when it expires.
* Fridgy's built-in **Recipe Tracker** matches recipe ingredients to ingredients in your inventory and helps to keep track of the quantity of ingredients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find recipes / ingredients based on their name.
    * What it does: allows the user to find recipes / ingredients that contain the keywords provided by the user
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user having many recipes / ingredients will definitely need to have a way to search for the right recipe / ingredient fast
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list recipes
  * What it does: allows the user to list all recipes in the Recipe Book
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because after find command, the list is filtered and the user may want to see the full list of recipes back
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Rework the GUI
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the application now fits the user requirements and is pleasing to the eye
    * Highlights: UI design. Reworking the GUI also requires a deep understanding of JavaFX and how each component works
* **Minor Enhancements**: More appropriate error messages for some commands in Fridgy

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=alissayarmantho)

* **Project management**:
    * Add deadlines to milestones
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added more details of the `UI` feature.

    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
