# Introduction

Fridgy is a **desktop app for managing an inventory of food as well as a list of recipes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Fridgy can get your fridge inventory and recipe sorted out faster than traditional GUI apps.
