# Introduction

Fridgy is a **desktop app for managing an Inventory of food as well as a RecipeBook of recipes**, optimized for use via 
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type 
fast, Fridgy can get your fridge Inventory and recipe sorted out faster than traditional GUI apps.

Fridgy was made to help people living in shared spaces manage their fridges better, since it can get very messy and 
difficult to keep track of several items from different people. It has the ability to track your ingredients in the
fridge as well as your recipes. It can help to flag out expiring and expired ingredients in your fridge. Moreover, it 
is equipped with features to improve users' convenience, such as automatic deduction of ingredients after cooking a 
recipe.
